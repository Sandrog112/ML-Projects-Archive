# ML Projects Archive

Welcome to my data science projects! Here, you will find a collection of projects that showcase my skills and experience in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. I am passionate about turning data into actionable insights and developing models to solve real-world problems. 

## Projects

- [Credit Score Classification](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Credit%20Score%20Classification.ipynb): This project involves building a classification model to predict the credit score for 100,000 customers based on their personal data. The model analyzes key features such as payment history, credit mix, and payment behavior to classify customers accurately. It leverages advanced machine learning techniques to ensure high predictive accuracy.

- [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Customer%20Churn%20Prediction.ipynb): This project focuses on predicting customer churn by analyzing personal data of customers who have already left the company. The model identifies patterns and key indicators of churn, enabling the business to take proactive measures to retain customers. It applies machine learning algorithms to forecast which customers are at risk of churning.

- [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Customer%20Segmentation.ipynb): This project segments mall customers into distinct groups based on their gender, age, annual income, and spending behavior. By applying clustering techniques, the model identifies patterns in customer demographics and spending habits, helping businesses to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

- [Drug Classification](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Drug%20Classification.ipynb): This project classifies patients into different drug categories based on their medical data, including age, gender, blood pressure levels, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratios. The model leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the most suitable drug for each patient, enhancing personalized treatment recommendations.

- [Loan Default Prediction](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Loan%20Default%20Prediction%20Using%20Deep%20Learning.ipynb): This project utilizes deep learning techniques to predict loan defaults based on borrowers' financial and demographic data. The model analyzes various factors, such as credit history, income, and loan characteristics, to assess the likelihood of default. By accurately predicting defaults, it aids financial institutions in risk management and decision-making processes.

- [Recommender Systems](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Recommender%20Systems.ipynb): This project implements four main types of recommender systems: popularity-based, content-based, user-based, and item-based. Each system utilizes customer ratings, personal data, movie ratings, and movie characteristics to deliver personalized recommendations. By analyzing user preferences alongside item features, the model enhances the user experience and drives engagement by suggesting relevant movies or products.

- [Email Spam Detection](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Spam%20Detection.ipynb): This project develops an Email Spam detection model using basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By analyzing the text content of emails, the model classifies messages as either spam or not spam. Techniques such as tokenization, text vectorization, and classification algorithms are utilized to identify patterns in language that are indicative of spam. This model enhances email filtering, improving user experience by reducing unwanted messages and prioritizing relevant content.

- [Data Preparation, EDA, and Feature Engineering](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20preperation%2C%20EDA%20and%20Feature%20Engineering%20for%20Bank%20Deposit%20Campaign.ipynb):This project focuses on preparing, exploring, and engineering features from the Bank Marketing dataset, which contains information about telemarketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese bank. The objective is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic, economic, and campaign-related features. The code includes deep, detailed processes of data preperation, EDA and dimensionality reduction.

- [Air Quality Regression Model](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Air%20Quality%20Regression%20Model.ipynb): This project is about creating the regression model, which tries to guess the air quality coefficient based on air's different chemical and biological compositions. The dataset includes 9358 hourly readings from 5 metal oxide chemical sensors in an Air Quality Monitoring Device, deployed at road level in a polluted Italian city from March 2004 to February 2005.

- [Weather Prediction with Various Models](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Weather%20Prediction%20with%20Various%20Models.ipynb): This project aims to predict weather conditions, specifically the likelihood of rainfall the following day, using various meteorological variables. The dataset includes daily weather observations, capturing features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure, among others. The project involves building multiple classification models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to predict whether it will rain the next day based on historical weather data. The goal is to assess the performance of these models and determine the most accurate method for weather prediction based on the provided features.

- [Earthquake Clustering](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Earthquake%20Clustering.ipynb): This project clusters global earthquake events based on their geographical location (longitude and latitude), intensity (Richter scale), and focal depth. By applying clustering techniques, the model identifies patterns in earthquake characteristics and geographical trends, enabling better insights into seismic activity and aiding in understanding regional earthquake behavior

- [Classification and Regression with Tree-Based Models](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Classification%20and%20Regression%20with%20Tree-Based%20Models.ipynb): This project focuses on utilizing tree-based models for both classification and regression tasks on two distinct datasets: an Air Quality dataset and a Weather dataset. For the Air Quality dataset, regression models were developed to estimate pollutant concentrations like Benzene, CO, and NOx based on sensor data. For the Weather dataset, classification models were employed to predict the likelihood of rainfall the following day using meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. The project highlights the performance of tree-based models in handling diverse data types and achieving accurate predictions across environmental and meteorological domains.

- [Neural Network for Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/Sandrog112/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Neural%20Network%20for%20Diabetes%20Prediction.ipynb): This project involves building and training different architectures of neural networks for binary classification to predict diabetes using a medical dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The dataset includes features such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and the target variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0). Several insightful experiments will be conducted to compare the performance of various network architectures and optimize the model's accuracy in predicting diabetes.
